  <p align="center" class="Stil1">Services Overview </p>
  <p align="justify" class="Stil4">1 Introduction </p>
  <p align="justify" class="Stil6">A service in APOXI is used by applications to provide functionality to other applications. This avoids dependencies 
    between applications. In software engineering terms this is called loose coupling. Services initiate actions in 
  other applications.</p>
  <p align="justify" class="Stil4">2 Service Broker</p>
  <p align="justify" class="Stil6">Every service has a Global Unique ID. So there must be one instance which oversees all available services within 
    APOXI. This instance is the Service Broker. It knows about all services, and applications can query it for specific 
    services. There are some analogies in this concept, when comparing it to other well-known object management 
  models such as CORBA or Microsoft's COM.</p>
  <p align="justify" class="Stil6">    Each service needs to register to the service Broker inorder to be available for other applications. The calling 
    application has to make sure that the requested service is available before executing a service-call. However an 
available service can be temporarly inaccesible to the user.</p>
  <p align="justify" class="Stil4">3 Service Concept</p>
  <p align="justify" class="Stil6">The following example illustrates the service concept:</p>
  
<div align="justify">
      <ol>
        <li class="Stil6">A WAP Browser shows a page with a mail to link</li>
          <li class="Stil6">The user clicks on it</li>
          <li class="Stil6">The WAP application asks the Service Broker whether there is a SendMail service available</li>
          <li class="Stil6">If available, invoking the service results in opening a &quot;Send Mail&quot; Window</li>
      </ol>
</div>
  <p align="justify"><br>
    <span class="Stil6">The WAP application in this example does not know which object has implemented the SendMail service. The 
    Service Broker hides this information. The WAP application just knows about the interface the service is offering. </span><span class="Stil6">To be independent from the service mplementation, the WAP application should not have knowledge about the 
  specific service-implementing class (object) at compile-time. 
  </span></p>
  <p align="justify"><span class="Stil6">Services are mainly used to exchange data or invoke actions at a foreign application without the need of returning 
    a result.</span></p>
  <p align="justify"><span class="Stil6">  Asynchronous execution is realized by internally forwarding the service-call by a post-message to the service 
  implementing the application itself.</span></p>
  <p align="justify"><span class="Stil6">  It is recommended to implement the service interface utilizing the facade-design pattern. The facade pattern 
  provides a simple unified interface and the lower level implementation is Application depended and hidden to the 
user. E.g. the SMS and EMS service implementations use the same common service interface.</span></p>
  <p align="justify" class="Stil4">4  Implementing a Service</p>
  <p align="justify" class="Stil6">    All the MMI services available in the system are defined in the file MmiServices. Each service has a system wide 
unique ID. All the service IDs are defined in the MmiServices file.</p>
  <p align="justify" class="Stil20">&nbsp;</p>
