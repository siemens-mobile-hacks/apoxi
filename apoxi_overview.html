<h1>1 Introduction</h1>

<p >APOXI is an object oriented application framework for
development of man machine interface and applications for mobile terminals. It
is designed to meet the special requirements of mobile, embedded devices and
exposes APIs which are specific to mobile phones.</p>

<p  style='background:white'>Please note - APOXI does not
incorporate ready to use applications but only provides the means for rapid MMI
and application development. MMI and applications are built on top of APOXI. More
about Comneons offerings of ready to use MMI and applications at the end of
this document.</p>

<p >An application framework frees developers from daily
re-occurring tasks and the need of starting his implementation tasks from
scratch. The developer starts his project with an functionally empty
application template and fills this template with functionality of his
application. To implement these functionality the developer uses services and
APIs exposed by the framework. Well designed frameworks only leave
implementation tasks to the developer which relate directly to the application
functionality. </p>

<p ><a href="classApplication.html">Application</a> frameworks guide developers through development
process and implement paradigms the developer can or should follow. This
significantly reduces the training efforts for developers and speeds up
implementation time. Developers using the APOXI framework do not need to be
mobile application development experts, but will find themselves in a software
environment which is very similar to desktop (e.g. Windows) development. Of
course embedded devices still restrict implementation in terms of real time
behavior, memory and computing resources which APOXI can’t overcome – but APOXI
helps handling these issues. Developers using APOXI simply take profit from the
vast experience of APOXI developers.</p>

<p >As no application framework can cover all functionality of
all applications, frameworks specialize to specific domains. The popular
framework Microsoft Foundation Classes (MFC) specializes on MS Windows
<a href="classApplication.html">Application</a> development. Applications are implemented following the
Model-View-Control (MVC) paradigm, which is one of most popular paradigms for
implementing graphical user interfaces. Other domains covered by MFC are data
base access etc.</p>

<p >Like MFC is specialized for Windows application development,
APOXI is optimized for needs of mobile phone MMI and application development.
For this, APOXI exposes services and APIs for following domains:</p>

<p class=MsoCaption>APOXI abstracts underlying system</p>

<p >The main components of APOXI are GUI services, ADC and ASC,
and application control mechanism. Many of the other functionality are side
products of the implementation of these basic building blocks. </p>

<p >APOXI counts more then 250 classes so far – small helpers to
complex code monsters. These classes are implemented by a team of very
experienced developers, most of them with vast experience in application
development and object oriented programming. Thus developers using these
classes do not only benefit from the functionality exposed by the framework,
but also learn OO technologies from experts.</p>

<p >The libraries Kernel and Auxiliary may be used from any
library. The libraries AddOns and Compat are optional: AddOns contains
extensions to the APOXI core libraries, which may be useful for an extended
MMI. Compat contains obsolete classes to provide backward compatibility for
applications written with older APOXI versions.</p>

</span>Using APOXI – A Simple Use Case</a></h1>

<p >ASC exposes – among other services – interfaces for
receiving and sending SMS PDUs. In order to ease the handling of these PDUs a wrapper
class has been implemented that holds one or more PDUs (i.e. concatenated SMS).
An application programmer must not know about PDU structure (header fields,
data encoding etc). </p>

<p >When sending a text message, the programmer simply creates
an instance of the PDU class and passes the message text to the SetText class
method. The method internally handles encoding, partitioning the string into
multiple PDUs if the string length exceeds the capacity of a single PDU, and
initializes the according header fields (sequence number etc.). Other header
fields are initialized as far as possible with default values. Thus sending a
text message using this class only requires very little knowledge about SMS
internals.</p>

<p >Experienced programmers can access all header fields and
data area of PDU with other class methods.</p>

<p >If a concatenated SMS is sent, the developer must not care
if the protocol stack supports sending concatenated SMS. He simply passes the
PDU object to the according function and ASC will send single SMS messages if
the signaling stack does not support that feature.</p>
