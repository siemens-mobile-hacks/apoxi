  <p align="center" class="Stil1">Voice Recognition Overview </p>
  <p align="justify" class="Stil4">1 Introduction </p>
  <p align="justify" class="Stil6">APOXI Voice Recognition (VR) module provides an object oriented interface for APOXI applications and APOXI 
  core modules to use Voice Recognition.</p>
  <p align="justify" class="Stil4">    2 Overview</p>
  <p align="justify" class="Stil6">    With APOXI VR, applications can start voice recognition for commands they need and train speaker dependent 
  commands. APOXI VR is also used for managing the commands.</p>
  <p align="justify" class="Stil6">    An overview of the VR system is given in the following dependency diagram (Figure 1).</p>
  
<div align="justify">
  <table width="98%"  border="1" align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" bordercolor="#000000">
    <tr>
      <td height="343"><div align="center"><img src="figures/VR_Depenendency.png" width="290" height="304"></div></td>
    </tr>
  </table>
</div>
  <p align="justify" class="Stil22">Figure&nbsp;1.  VR Dependency Diagram</p>
  <p align="justify" class="Stil6">APOXI VR and the VR Host Task communication is done by using a function call from APOXI VR to VR. A callback 
  registered by APOXI VR with VR which is called by VR whenever it wants to send data to APOXI VR.</p>
  <p align="justify" class="Stil6">    APOXI VR is also responsible for allocating and freeing the audio device used for recording speech. This has to 
    be done in APOXI VR because the APOXI audio priority mechanisms must not be disturbed by VR Host and VR 
    Engine.</p>
  <p align="justify" class="Stil6">    For storing the templates used by the VR Engine for recognition, APOXI VR makes use of the Root File System. 
    By using the RFS, the storing of template data can be done using various medias like FFS, Memory Cards, etc.</p>
  <p align="justify" class="Stil4">3 Features of Voice Recognition</p>
  <p align="justify" class="Stil6">APOXI VR provides:Accessibility for APOXI modules and APOXI-based applications</p>

        <div align="justify">Mechanism to manage templates (voice tags)</div>
      </div>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p align="justify" class="Stil23">3.1 VR Templates</p>
  <p align="justify" class="Stil6">A VR template represents a voice tag for a command (e.g. name for dialing a phonebook entry, menu item, etc.). 
    For each recognition process, the VR engine is fed with a set of VR templates to tell the engine, what it should 
  listen for. Depending on the used recognition mode, one or more of the VR templates will be recognized.</p>
  <p align="justify" class="Stil6">    There are three types of templates:</p>
  
    <div align="justify">
        <ol>
          <li>
            <span class="Stil6">System wide fixed templates: These VR templates can be used by every application</span></li>
            <li>
              <span class="Stil6">VR Templates which are created by the applications and are stored to a file system Applications can list, create, and delete their own VR templates but cannot delete system wide fixed templates or 
                        templates of other applications. Applications can also playback speaker-dependent templates.</span></li>
        </ol>
</div>
  <p align="justify" class="Stil23">3.2 Start voice recognition</p>
  <p align="justify" class="Stil6">An application can start voice recognition with a set of templates, of which one or more shall be recognized. The 
    application will be informed which of the templates has been recognized. If necessary it is possible to abort voice 
  recognition when conflicts with other functions occur (e.g. an incoming call overrides voice recognition).</p>
  <p align="justify" class="Stil23">    3.3 Train speaker dependent templates</p>
  <p align="justify" class="Stil6">    An application can do training for a speaker-dependent command (e.g. name-dialing). The recorded template is 
    stored in the system and can be used by the application until it decides to discard the template. If necessary it is 
    possible to abort training when conflicts with other tasks occur (e.g. an incoming call overrides training). </p>
  <p align="justify" class="Stil23">    3.4 Create speaker independent templates</p>
  <p align="justify" class="Stil6">    A speaker-independent template based on an ASCII-string can be created by an application if G2A is provided by 
    the VR Engine. The template is stored in the system and can be used by the application until it decides to discard 
    the template.</p>
  <p align="justify" class="Stil4">    4 Class architecture</p>
  <p align="justify" class="Stil6">    The main class for APOXI VR are <em>VrHandler</em>. These class handle the communication between MMI and APOXI 
    VR as well as between APOXI VR and VR Host Task.</p>
  <p align="justify" class="Stil6">    The other important classes in APOXI VR are message classes, which are used to transport information from the 
    VR Engine to MMI.</p>
