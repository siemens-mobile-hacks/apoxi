  <p align="justify" class="Stil1">Bluetooth Overview </p>
  <p align="justify" class="Stil4">1 Introduction </p>
  <p align="justify" class="Stil6">Bluetooth is a computing and telecommunications industry specification that describes how mobile phones, 
  computers and other BT devices can easily interconnect wireless with each other.</p>
  <p align="justify" class="Stil6">    The APOXI Bluetooth framework forms a part of the APOXI framework and is used to support Bluetooth 
    functionality to the MMI and MMI Applications. This Bluetooth functionality includes the dial up network, head set 
support, etc.</p>
  <p align="justify" class="Stil4">    2 Architecture</p>
  <p align="justify" class="Stil6">    
    The APOXI Bluetooth framework connects the Bluetooth MMI &amp; MMI Applications to the Bluetooth API &amp; Bluetooth 
Stack. The gray areas in the following figure form the APOXI Bluetooth framework.</p>
  <p align="justify" class="Stil6">    The Bluetooth Java API forms the interface to the &quot;BtAPOXI Base Classes&quot;, so that the can be used out of Java-
    Applications. The interface to Bluetooth Java-Applications is formed by Java classes that are implemented via the 
&quot;Java Native Interface (JNI)&quot; to gain access to the classes of the APOXI Bluetooth Framework, which are 
implemented.</p>

</div>
  <p align="justify" class="Stil22">Figure&nbsp;1. Bluetooth Architecture</p>
  <p align="justify" class="Stil6">The lower level interface - the interface to the Bluetooth API and the Bluetooth Stack - is written in C and SDL. 
    The BtAPOXI Base Classes do not communicate to the Bluetooth Stack directly. It always uses the Bluetooth API 
  to query some information from the Bluetooth Stack or send commands to the Bluetooth Stack. </p>
  <p align="justify" class="Stil6">    Bluetooth is defined of different profiles and each profile provides certain procedures and services.The most basic 
    profile is the Generic Access Profile.</p>
  <p align="justify" class="Stil4">3 Generic Functionality</p>
  <p align="justify" class="Stil6">Bluetooth application is a composition of different BT profiles, specified by [BT-Profiles-Spec]. The basic 
    application functionality provides a main entry point for the user and common functionality for each profile. 
    Bluetooth application is unitized on profile level, which means, it is possible to add or remove functionality that is 
    covered by profile without any impact to the applications architecture. Profiles are encapsulated as separate 
  modules offering an API to other profiles. Profiles can interact using other profiles APIs.</p>
  <p align="justify" class="Stil4">4 General Overview of Packages</p>
  <p align="justify" class="Stil6">    The General overview of packages in APOXI Bluetooth are shown in Figure 2.</p>

  <p align="justify" class="Stil22">Figure&nbsp;2. General Overview of Packages</p>
  <p align="justify" class="Stil4">5 Bluetooth Profiles</p>
  <p align="justify" class="Stil6">    Bluetooth uses several different &quot;profiles&quot; for different sorts of interaction. These are designed for a specific task, 
    and not all devices support all profiles. The Bluetooth profiles provided by APOXI Bluetooth and their usecases 
are described in this section.</p>
  <p align="justify" class="Stil23">5.1 GAP &amp; SDAP Profile</p>
<p align="justify" class="Stil6">    The use cases of GAP &amp; SDAP Profile are explained in this section.</p>
  <p align="justify" class="Stil29">    5.1.1 GAP (Generic Access Profile)</p>
  <p align="justify" class="Stil6">    Defines the generic requirements for detecting and establishing a connection to a Bluetooth device. This profile 
    defines the generic procedures related to discovery of Bluetooth devices,connecting to Bluetooth devices etc. This 
profile defines the usecases for the local device. The use cases are listed in the following:</p>
  
  <div align="justify">
          <ul class="Stil6">
            <li>
              <strong>Set Discoverability</strong>: If this is not set for local device, the other devices searching for Bluetooth devices will not be able to discover that particular device</li>
              <li>
                <strong>Set Device Name</strong> : Sets the Bluetooth device name for the local device</li>
              <li>
                <strong>Set Pairability</strong>: Sets the pairabilty for the local device or in other words enables the device to accept the pairing.</li>
              <li>
                <strong>Set Connectivity</strong>: if connectivity is set on local device, other devices can connect to the device when it comes within their area of radio coverage</li>
              <li>
                <strong>Pair</strong>: Pairing of devices means to make communication among devices available via a common communication code. To generate this communication code the user is prompted to enter a security code.:When no pairing is done, every time a remote device tries to connect to the local device, depending on the security settings of the requested profile, a request for a pin number is executed.</li>
              <li>
                <strong>Unpair</strong>: Unpairing destroys a former created pairing of two Bluetooth Devices i.e, pairing with the selected device is cancelled. The user should be informed that the device is no longer a paired device.</li>
              <li>
                <strong>Trust</strong> : This feature is only available if the state of the device is paired and not trusted. It is part of the context menu of the selected device and after selecting this feature the user should be informed that the device is marked as trusted. Marking a device as trusted device overcomes the authorization, i.e. confirming a connection request is no more required because the device is authorized to establish a connection. </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Untrust</strong>: This feature is only available if the state of the device is paired and trusted. This feature makes a trusted device not trusted.</li>
