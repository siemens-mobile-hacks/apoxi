			<ul style="line-height: 150%">
				<li><b>Completely written in C++:</b> All characteristics of an object orientated programming language, like polymorphism, inheritance and encapsulation, are used in a strict manner and lead to an easy to use, but powerful framework.</li>
				<li><b>Event-based communication:</b> All actions are triggered by events. The communication between the components is done by messages. This proven approach offers strong benefits in comparison to state-machines.</li>

				<li><b>Controls</b> for menus, radiobuttons, checkboxes, listboxes, editors, ... which can be integrated within windows in an easy manner.</li>
				<li><b>Dynamically changeable look and feel:</b> The look and feel of the menus, windows, buttons and other controls can be altered during runtime using the theme manager.</li>
				<li><b>Multilingual support:</b> The full integration of Unicode and the language manager facilitates a switch of languages at any time.</li>
				<li><b>Image support:</b> Encoders and decoders for a broad range of image formats are available.</li>
